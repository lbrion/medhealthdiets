    #webmd
      h3 WebMD
      h4 Information Overload
      p
        | WebMD has information about almost every medical condition you can think of, which makes it hard to sift through all of the information available. As opposed to many distinct articles about the same thing, medhealthdiets hopes to combine all the relevant information about a medical diet into one page. For example, WebMD currently has many articles about a low-sodium diet including how to eat low-sodium at restaurants, the foods you should eat, and the foods you should avoid. Medhealthdiets hopes to have all the relevant information on the same page so you don't have to look everywhere for the information you need.
      h4 Disjoint Information
      p
        | WebMD may have many resources about the diets themselves, but medhealthdiets hopes to tie together the diet with the disease it's used to help control. Instead of scattered information which may leave you not knowing why you're following the particular diet for your disease, medhealthdiets will explain why you're eating a certain way, and the mechanisms that make the diet help with your condition.
    #mayoclinic
      h3 Mayo Clinic
      h4 Lack of Diet Information 
      p
        | While Mayo Clinic does have comprehensive medical insight into the science and medicine behind many diseases, it does not address how diets may be used to deal with them. It does however have a single weight loss diet that it supports aptly dubbed "The Mayo Clinic Diet". Medhealthdiets wants to provide the medical backgorund about diseases just as Mayo Clinic does, and will refer to Mayo Clinic for disease information frequently. Disease information however is not the only goal of medhealthdiets, as we want to address how different diets would help dealing with diseases.
      h4 Too Much Disease Depth
      p
        | Mayo Clinic's website is all about educating their visitors about the diseases they have. While medhealthdiets also wants to educate its visitors about their diseases, it wants to focus on the dietary aspect of the lifestyle change necessary to deal with their disease. Medhealthdiets also hopes to provide resources that will allow visitors to easily make their lifestyle change with a support group of real people to ask questions and share experiences with.

      h4 May Be Misleading
      p
        | While Blogs at times have a lot of good quality information, sometimes they spread popular claims that aren't well researched. At medhealthdiets we hope to avoid that by providing reliable sources and linking users to trusted external material about various things. Mayo Clinic is an excellent resource for disease information, recipes.com is an excellent resource for recipes, and blogs are great for anecdotal evidence and support, medhealthdiets aims to be all of these and more by linking to the pertinent external resources and doing research of our own.
