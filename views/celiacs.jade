    #overview
    h2 Overview
    p Celiac's disease is an immune reaction to eating gluten, which is a protein found in many "whole" grains. Eating gluten disrupts the function of the small intenstine causing pain and over time damages the small intestine's ability to absorb nutrients. This can lease to discomfort, diarrhea, as well as weight loss. As the ability to absorb nutrients drops, other life functions will suffer with similar effects of malnourishment. Following a diet that avoids gluten will manage symptoms and promote healthy small intestine function.
